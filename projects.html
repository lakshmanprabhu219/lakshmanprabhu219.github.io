			<h2 class="centerHeading">Burglar Alarm Project</h2>
			<p class="aboutPara">This project basically involved developing a miniature burglar system using IoT, and 
			an App which would receive messages from that alarm. App was made using Android Studio.This project took approximately 
			1 month to complete. It was kinda hard at the beginning ,but that's the base of every project right. At the end of the 
			day you either learn something new or end up doing something great.</p>

			<h2 class="centerHeading">Pneumonia Detection</h2>
			<p class="aboutPara">Using the Image Dataset available from Kaggle, I was able to develop a machine learning model that intelligently 
			classifies if a person is affected by pneumonia or not, given the images of lung x-rays. The model had an accuracy of 0.95 on the training 
			set and over 0.85 on the validation set. I used Google's brilliant Tensorflow API for this purpose.</p>

			<h2 class="centerHeading">Zombie Buster</h2>
			<p class="aboutPara">Being said I was overwhelmingly interested in Games , I wanted to make a game right from the college inception, and 
			finally ended up making a game ,which costed me about 2 months. Honestly, if not for this COVID-19 ,I wouldn't have been able to 
			develop this game. This game basically involves constant running like Temple Run, but with the added bonus of shooting zombie as you go. I 
			added achievements, score, and health to the player. 
			Only after finishing this game, I realized how much time consuming it is to make a seemingly-simple game.</p>
