		<p id="Brief">Hi ,I am Lakshman from Chennai, India.If you've come to this page,I'm assuming that my home page was not bad enough. Basically, I'm an introvert, 
			and I'm not that kind of person who would basically provoke interest in you. So, if you find this page boring just like this paragraph, please excuse me.</p>

		<h2 class="centerHeading">Schooling</h2>
		<p class="aboutPara">Being brought up Chrompet,Chennai,I studied at SSM from my 4th grade all the way upto 12th Grade. School used to be fun, but I realized it only
			after joining college. My friends were great, teachers were not badass atleast, and things went smoothly.I was an active person in school, but
			surely not one among those gang of toppers.I achieved a percentile of 95.6, thanks to my school for that. Football is one of the few things I 
			miss very much, It used to be a habit, now it has become an occasion. But the best part is, I still have my school friends in touch.</p>

		<h2 class="centerHeading">College Life</h2>
		<p class="aboutPara">You would have known how my College life is if you have read how my schooling was. College life was going pretty well in the 
		first year, but things changed after that. Starting from the second year, you would have to move from one classroom to another every period, since
		different classes have different venues. So, the chances of you having friends in any given class is minimal, and even if you had, it would be boring. 
		Let's see if it has any chance of exciting me in the final year;

	<div class="aboutDiv">
		<h2 class="centerHeading">Interests and Hobbies</h2>
		<p class="aboutPara">To be honest, I have hell a lot of interests. I like graphic designing very much, and game development hence. The AAA games
		made every year always amuse me. With the level of detail in the models at every frame, I am very much curious on exploring how those work. Data Science is
		the fast growing trend in this time period, and so is my interest towards it.But here's one thing I would like to mention;"Data Science is not about 
		fit() and predict(); Even a primary school kid can do that; It's about the math behind every algorithm;". If you've realized this, only then you're
		eligible to be a data analyst. Okay ,I've spoken this much, but am I a data scientist? Not until now, but I'll become one very soon.<br>
		I spend my leisure time by watching movies on occasion ,but most often by, playing video games and playing piano.</p>
